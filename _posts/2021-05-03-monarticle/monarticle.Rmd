Making this portfolio was a big deal for me and it was such a different and interesting experience and it's something completely new for me it's true it was difficult for me especially with the use of R language to write and publish the articles, and in addition there were too many steps to follow to realize and analyze it , and it taught me a lot of time but i learned so many things such as how to write a scientific article and new information about Alzheimer's disease and also through these articles I have enriched my English vocabulary
